# JCIT Standards for CMS Integrations  
Version 10.0 – July 2025

This directory defines all JCIT requirements that apply directly to CMS integrations with re:SearchTX.  
It isolates and clarifies the subset of standards that CMS vendors must follow so that case, document, and index data are transmitted correctly, consistently, and in compliance with statewide rules.

This documentation eliminates ambiguity and establishes a definitive reference for:

- Data exchange requirements  
- Case category & case type mapping  
- Case security and document security rules  
- EventType alignment requirements  
- Criminal document type restrictions  
- Case index metadata requirements  
- Public access and Registered User Matrix behavior  

Subpages provide detailed requirements for each CMS-impacting JCIT section.
