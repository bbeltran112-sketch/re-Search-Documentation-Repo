The Support Playbook defines how re:SearchTX interprets case data, applies JCIT standards, evaluates security, processes EventTypes, and synchronizes content.  
It is the primary source for diagnosing visibility issues, indexing discrepancies, and CMS/vendor integration problems.

This playbook is designed for:

- CMS vendors  
- EFSP integrators  
- Tyler BIS support analysts  
- TPMs and product/engineering staff  
- Court IT partners  

---

## Purpose

The Support Playbook provides:

- JCIT role and visibility logic  
- EventType processing rules  
- CaseSecurity and DocumentSecurity behavior  
- Examples of correct and incorrect XML  
- System behavior flows  
- Troubleshooting and escalation guidelines  

These rules form the foundation for consistent support, onboarding, and CMS validation.
